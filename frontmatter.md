## Impetus
When I was a data scientist at Quora, I used to have people ask me for resources for learning SQL. I struggled to find something I could stand behind because I felt that a good resource had to be free, not require registration, and care about pedagogy&mdash;it had to genuinely care about its users and there was nothing like that around.

By overcoming some minor <a href="#technicals">technical hurdles</a>, I believe that **Select Star SQL** has met this standard. My hope is that like <a href='http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters'>Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a> and <a href='https://beautifulracket.com'>Beautiful Racket</a> have done for Haskell and Racket, **Select Star SQL** will become the best place on the internet for learning SQL.

## Pedagogy
These principles have guided the design of this project:
   - <p><strong>Programming is best learnt by doing.</strong><br>
     A high proportion of the material consists of exercises, and struggling with them should occupy most of your time.</p>
   - <p><strong>Exercises should be realistic and substantial.</strong><br>
     To quote <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40435064/what-alan-kay-thinks-about-the-iphone-and-technology-now">Alan Kay</a>: "You never let [the learner] do something that isnâ€™t the real thing&mdash;but you have to work your ass off to figure out what the real thing is in the context of the way their minds are working at that developmental level."</p>
     <p>Likewise, the exercises here have been designed to introduce increasingly sophisticated SQL techniques while exploring the dataset in ways that people would actually be interested in.</p>
   - <p><strong>Learning to program is learning a mental model</strong><br>
     Our goal here isn't to learn the rules for how to use <code>GROUP BY</code> or when to pick a <code>LEFT JOIN</code> over an <code>INNER JOIN</code>. We know we've been successful if after writing a SQL query, you can close your eyes and imagine what the computer would do and what output it would give. Only then will you be able to solve real-world problems with SQL.

## Dataset
Our dataset documents Texas death row inmates executed from 1976, when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty, to the present. It was extracted from the <a href='https://www.tdcj.state.tx.us/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html'>Texas Department of Criminal Justice</a> website using automatic means where possible. However, much of the pre-1995 data is only available as images of physical documents and these required painstaking manual extraction.

The raw data is available as a csv for <a href="data/tx_deathrow_full.csv">download</a>. Because of the manual extraction and cleaning that was done, it is probably the most complete set of Texas death row data on the internet. You can also explore a subset of it that I've prepared for this book:
<sql-exercise
  data-question="This is an interactive code editor. You can edit query below."
  data-comment="Shift+Enter is the keyboard shortcut for running the query."
  data-default-text="SELECT *
FROM executions
LIMIT 3"></sql-exercise>

On one level, the data is simply a part of a mundane programming book. On another, each row represents immense suffering, lives lost, and in some cases amazing redemption and acceptance. In preparing for this dataset, I was deeply moved by a number of the statements and found myself re-evaluting my position on capital punishment. I hope that as we examine the data, you too will contemplate the deeper issues at play.
