#### Notes for development under windows.

The easiest is to use windows subsystem for linux (wsl) to be able to use the commands described on the jekyll website. Once wsl is installed and this repository is cloned, one can run `wsl` in Microsoft PowerShell. After having installed jekyll as it is described on the [official jekyll website](https://jekyllrb.com/). Then, in the linux command line, move to the repository directory and run:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
This will compile the website and create a local server to test the website. Press crtl+C to stop the development server.
